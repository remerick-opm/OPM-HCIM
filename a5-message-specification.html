<h3>What is the Message Specification?</h3<

<p>As with all industries, the federal government relies on the exchange of information between IT applications. This information is contained in messages that have a defined structure that is known and agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. This “common language” – the standards governing this structure – are known as a message specification. This specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defines the uniform structure of pay-related messages and provides the relationships between data elements for all systems in the federal compensation and benefits ecosystem;</li>
<li>Leverages the HCIM to provide understandable and interoperable data elements so that it can be quickly and painlessly implemented by consumers and providers;</li>
<li>Includes extensibility to support future functionality.</li>

<p>The purpose of the message specification guide is to describe the Human Capital Business Reference Model's (HCBRM) A5 Compensation & Benefits Message Specifications MessageSpecExtract. This file is presented in the form of an Excel document and contains the technical details of the data transmission that will enable Federal Compensation & Benefits IT systems to communicate with each other. This document provides the business and technical context needed to read, interpret, and apply the message specification.</p>
