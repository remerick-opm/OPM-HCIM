| Domain Values                    | Each month the HRLOB releases the most up-to-date Domain Value Repository. Domain Values and any associated metadata in the repository have been collected, maintained and stored by the HRLOB. The table below displays the past Domain Value releases. The table below contains all current and past Domain Value releases along with the release dates. Please use the table below to download or view the most up to date Domain Value file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ecosystem Schema                 | The HCIM Ecosystem Schema is a language that addresses constraints of the XML file. It presents multiple layers of rules to address these issues and regulate data exchanges. This schema will assist the Federal HC community in implementing a higher quality of data standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) | A set of questions and answers refer to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Human Capital Information Model (HCIM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Key Terms Catalog (KTC)          | The Key Terms Catalog includes key terms that are widely used throughout the Federal HR community as well as throughout the HCIM data repository. The purpose of the catalog is to maintain a centralized repository of commonly used terms to enhance data standardization and quality. The Federal HR community uses terms and definitions from statutory, regulatory and policy sources. Collecting this content into a centralized repository assists implementation teams by providing a platform by which they can refer to disambiguate commonly misunderstood terms, research purpose and usage, and to better understand the impact of a specific Federal HR term |
| Message Specification            | As with all industries, the federal government relies on the exchange of information between IT applications. This information is contained in messages that have a defined structure that is known and agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. This “common language” – the standards governing this structure – are known as a message specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Registry                         | The HCIM Registry contains a listing of data elements within the HRLOB data standard that are implementation ready and fit for use. This list is an extract of the Human Capital Information Model (HCIM) and is in alignment with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 11179 naming standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Systems and Forms Mapping        | The Systems and Forms Mapping workbook includes all systems/forms that have been mapped to the HCIM. To be "mapped" refers to the linkage of a system's/form's elements to the HCIM data elements. Items from systems/forms are either linked to existing elements or added to the repository as new elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
