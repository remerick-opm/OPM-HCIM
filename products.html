|Message Specification| As with all industries, the federal government relies on the exchange of information between IT applications. This information is contained in messages that have a defined structure that is known and agreed upon by the sender and the receiver. This “common language” – the standards governing this structure – are known as a message specification.|
|Systems and Forms Mapping|The Systems and Forms Mapping workbook includes all systems/forms that have been mapped to the HCIM. To be "mapped" refers to the linkage of a system's/form's elements to the HCIM data elements. Items from systems/forms are either linked to existing elements or added to the repository as new elements.|
|Key Terms Catalog (KTC)| The Key Terms Catalog includes key terms that are widely used throughout the Federal HR community as well as throughout the HCIM data repository. The purpose of the catalog is to maintain a centralized repository of commonly used terms to enhance data standardization and quality. The Federal HR community uses terms and definitions from statutory, regulatory and policy sources. Collecting this content into a centralized repository assists implementation teams by providing a platform by which they can refer to disambiguate commonly misunderstood terms, research purpose and usage, and to better understand the impact of a specific Federal HR term|
